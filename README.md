# LHL_CapstoneProject_RoadAccidentsAnalysis_Tableau

## Overview
#### The objective of this Tableau project is to visually explore and analyze road accident data, uncovering insightful observations and trends. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises over half a million records spanning the years 2021-2022. All visualizations are crafted using Tableau. 

## Tech tools used:  
1. Excel: Downloaded data in Excel file.

2.  Pandas in Python and Jupyter:  Utilized Pandas within Jupyter for data cleaning, addressing duplicates and errors to ensure data accuracy. removing inconsistencies and enhancing reliability.

3. Tableau: Employed Tableau for comprehensive visualization and analysis of the cleaned dataset.

## Tableau Dashboard
#### The main dashboard provides an interactive view of road accident statistics, including geographical distribution, severity levels, and contributing factors


## Key Visualizations
1. Geographical Distribution Map: Visual representation of accident locations.
2. Accident Severity Analysis: Breakdown of accidents by severity levels such as Fatal, serious, slight.
3. Contributing factors:  Such as weather, Road type, Road surfaces and vehicle types.
4. created Kpis: Kpis such as Total accidents, total casualties, casualties based on different accident severities.

## Goal: 

#### Road accidents pose a significant and persistent threat to public safety, leading to injuries, fatalities, and economic losses. This project aimed to understand why accidents occur by examining factors like weather, road types, surfaces, vehicle types, and locations. 
#### We analyzed accident data over different years to determine if there was a change in accident rates. The goal was to identify patterns and potential causes behind accidents for better safety insights. By doing so, we aimed to contribute to strategies that could reduce accidents and enhance road safety.

## Outcomes: 

#### Our analysis suggests that weather, particularly snowy/ foggy, wasn't the main contributor to accidents. Car accidents were prominent as compared to other vehicle types, yet there was a notable decrease in fatal incidents from 2021 to 2022. Interestingly, there was a slight uptick in serious and slight accidents involving buses in 2022.
#### Notably, no fatal casualties were attributed to agricultural vehicles. Accidents were notably associated with dry road surfaces and single carriageways. Analyzing different districts showed differences in injuries and vehicle involvement. 
#### Encouragingly, all categories of casualties and total accidents showed a decline in 2022, indicating positive safety trends.



## Challenges: 

#### I faced some challenges while working on visualizations and analysis. The data was quite large, causing delays in loading. I also encountered problems creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and sparklines, but overcoming these hurdles taught me valuable lessons and strengthened the project.


## Future Goals: 

#### In the future if i get more data, I aim to look closely at important factors like the relation between time, location the influence of lighting. I'll also explore how age and gender play a role and examine the connection between accidents and alcohol. By examining these key factors, the goal is to enhance our understanding and contribute valuable insights to further improve road safety measures.
